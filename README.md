This is Code Self-Portrait project


### Technical Details
interpret Self-Portrait using P5.js drawing functions. In this project, I learned from Pointillism, using points to compose facial contours, and then using lines to compose facial features and other parts.
Also, I added color change code, The color change will make the picture look different (dynamic).
